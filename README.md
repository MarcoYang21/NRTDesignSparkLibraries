# NRTDesignSparkLibraries
This is the NeuroRobotic Technologies (NRT) DesignSpark PCB Layout libraries. I have converted
a bunch of libraries from other vendors, like SparkFun's eagle files, and imported them
for use in DesignSpark. I have also created a number of design files by hand for for parts
that I need in my designs. Any of the PCB designs that are released by NRT will be using
the parts in this library. These libraries work with DesignSpark 7.1. I originally built them
in 6.1, but I am pretty sure they will not work in that version now.

##Installation

Start DesignSpark 7.1 and go to the Files->Libraries menu. Then select the Folders tab. Click
the Add button and then Browse. Select this repository folder and click the Add button. Be 
sure that the Folder Enabled checkbox is checked. These libraries should now be available.
